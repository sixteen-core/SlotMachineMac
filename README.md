Slot machine is a software that works with the console, it ask you to select an option for example SPIN, so it spin the rollers, In short this must find all the ways that each symbol finds in the rollers, then it finds how much it pays per way and per range of rollers.

It's interesting because each spin gives you a random value on each roller, so based on it you get the result of the ways... try it yourserlf, also it comes with tests because was done with TDD
