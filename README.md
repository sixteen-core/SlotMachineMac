# SlotMachineMac

I built this library to simulate a slot machine in the console. You select actions like SPIN, and it calculates all possible combinations on the rollers, determines payouts per combination, and returns the results.

Each spin generates random values on the rollers, so every play produces different outcomes. It was developed with TDD and includes tests to ensure correctness.
